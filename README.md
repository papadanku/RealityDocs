# RealityDocs

Project Reality's official documentation.

## The Problem 

Project Reality's documentation is all over the place. 

- The manual is hosted on GitHub
- The Technical Information Wiki is hosted on **two** different sites
- The modding tutorials are post in the Project Reality Forums 

The three above points require the user to learn **three** seperate markup languages to contribute to all of them. 

## The Solution 

RealityDocs solves this issues by porting and hosting documentation to Sphinx. The benefits are the following: 

- Hostable in many places
- Directives support (useful for API documentation)
- Docstring support
- Flexable markup language
- Syntax highlighting for Python, C, and C++
- Users can contribute
- Viewable on mobile devices
