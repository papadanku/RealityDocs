3DsMax - Lightmapping Scene Setup
=================================

First create a new scene and go to :menuselection:`Customise --> Units Setup` and for lightmapping you need to set the :guilabel:`Display Unit Scale` to :guilabel:`Generic Units` and then click :guilabel:`System Unit Setup` and set :guilabel:`1 Unit` to "1.0 Inches" then click :guilabel:`Ok`. This will result in a scale of **1m (in BF2) = 10 Units (in Max)**.

.. Note::

    For modelling and exporting I recommend using Metric Meters but for Lightmapping its best to use Generic Units.
