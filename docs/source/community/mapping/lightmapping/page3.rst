3DsMax - Lightmapping Scene Setup
=================================

First create a new scene and go to "Customise > Units Setup" and for lightmapping you need to set the Display Unit Scale to "Generic Units" and then click "System Unit Setup" and set "1 Unit = " to "1.0 Inches" then click ok. This will result in a scale of **1m (in BF2) = 10 Units (in Max)**.

.. Note::

    For modelling and exporting I recommend using Metric Meters but for Lightmapping its best to use Generic Units.
