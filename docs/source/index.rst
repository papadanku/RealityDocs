The Technical Information Wiki is a resource for the BF2 community, a repository of technical information related to the games Battlefield 2 and the modification Project Reality. Specifically, we hope to collect a lot of useful information here related to using the embedded Python capabilities of these games, modding, game statistics, administration, etc.

This website is a "wiki", meaning that anyone can edit its contents in any way--add pages, change them, even delete them completely. Anyone can freely access the material here; if you'd like to edit it, too, all you have to do to is to create a (free) login for yourself, so we can keep track of who made what changes. Generally speaking, please try to keep the information on each page factual; if you'd like to discuss the content of a page, put the discussion on the related "talk" page (click the "discussion" tab at the top of the page in question).
