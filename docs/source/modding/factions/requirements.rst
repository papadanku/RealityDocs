Faction Requirements
====================

Sometimes, Community Factions ask us what "requirements" the PR team has before we can label them "ready" (which means.. ready for implementation).

Below are some guidelines we have set up to help you on your way a bit more. Please note that by meeting the requirements posted below, a faction is not automatically implemented in the first PR release. There's more than just having everything done by the rulebook. And it takes time and planning before the next step can be made.

----

Models
   All max scenes must be exported as ``.max`` 9 format.

Soldiers and Kits
   A complete set of soldier reskins. Don't use custom made soldier models, stick to the vanilla soldiers. This is to prevent kit geometries from looking all weird on other soldier models. The kit geometries' reskins also have to be completed.

   If you want to have your faction look different, create kit geometries. Make sure these kit geometries fit the vBF2 soldier models and work properly.

   All soldiers and kits have to be set up and named as it's currently done in PR.

Weapons
   - Fully operating weapons, weapon sounds and, animations
   - All weapons need to be named correctly to PR standards
   - All weapon textures need to be sized appropriately

Vehicles
   - Fully imported and correctly functioning set of vehicles
   - All vehicles need to be named correctly to PR standards
   - All vehicle textures need to be sized appropriately

Maps
   - **At least two maps**, created by/for your faction
   - All maps have to be completed and of course, should meet the PR standard

Sounds
   - Localized voices for all "roles" (commander, squad leader, grunt), up to PR standards
   - They must be well recorded with good amplitude
      - Completely dry with no room tone
      - Voice-over acting must be believable ('in character')

Other
   The whole faction must work properly and should be provided as a minimod which extends onto the current version of PR (like how PRSP was done up to now).
   
   The faction must have a full set of
      - Flags
      - Rallypoints
      - Spawners
      - Logistics/support trucks
      - Command posts
      - etc.
